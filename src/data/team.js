    copy: `My name is Alexandra Rojas and I am a Working Group member of Brand New Congress who lives out in Fullerton, CA. I believe in BNC because I don’t believe I have to choose a cause or an issue I am most passionate about. We are investing our time, energy, and resources in the American people — not our broken system.`

    copy: `America is declining into an oligarchy. It will take a "Brand New Congress" to reverse this decline. It will be the powerful culmination of the tens of millions of us that have decided to take a stand against the perverse influence of greed, greed that can be seen from Washington to Wall Street. We have many daunting tasks before us and the only way we can achieve them is by sticking together. The only force strong enough to make the changes that must be made is unity. Let's unify behind working people who we choose as our representatives in a "Brand New Congress."`

As a member of the BNC working group, I enjoy talking to people, giving speeches, and above all working towards governmental representation that we can be proud of. I started getting involved in all of this from the 2016 presidential campaign as a full time volunteer, meeting some of the people I now work alongside here at BNC. Brand New Congress is the thing that drives me every day, but more than that -- it makes me believe that a better future is possible.`

    copy: `My name is Isra Allison, and I am a Working Group member of Brand New Congress who lives in Charlotte, NC. I believe in Brand New Congress because the American people deserve a chance to vote for honest and non-corrupt candidates full of integrity. I support the Brand New Congress plan because it calls for bold action to take back our democracy with a slate of candidates who not only look like their communities but they also represent the needs and rights of the people rather than that of corporate interest.`

    copy: `As an engineer by profession, I am on the constant look-out for practical solutions for seemingly impossible problems. Brand New Congress is an elegant solution to fix the corrupting influence of lobbyists and corporations, the massive income inequality, our growing healthcare costs with diminishing returns, the realities of climate change, and systemic racial injustice. This engineer is working hard for a Brand New Congress -- the practical solution to take our democracy back and get America back on track again.`

    copy: `This campaign season was the first one where I heard a candidate speaking to me about the issues I cared about, and because of that I threw myself into politics in a way I never had before. Brand New Congress gives us another opportunity to build on the momentum from the presidential campaign season, and finally stop the influence of big money in politics and the lack of representation in our government.`

    copy: `Right now, we are in a constant battle against increasing income inequality, mass incarceration, and worsening climate change. All of us work tremendously hard to win victories here and there, but to actually change our society so that the battles are not uphill, we need to be able to create and enact the boldest plan this country has seen since the New Deal. The only way we can do this is if we create a cohesive, functioning Congress that is accountable to the people who elected it and not to the corporations funding their campaigns. This is why we need a Brand New Congress that agrees up front to work together to actually right this nation's course.`

    copy: `This is not a radical idea. It's simply how we were supposed to use our democracy. It's what some of the first American Revolutionaries told us we should do: have another revolution every time things got this out of wack. Lucky for us, they gave us a democracy. As rigged as our elections are right now, there's no better way to take back our country than to rally the people and win strong majorities in elections. Let's do it!`
