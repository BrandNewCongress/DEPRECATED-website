<h2>Welcome to the Office Team page!</h2>

<p>BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!</p>

<p>This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then <b>email the help desk at us@brandnewcongress.org</b> and tell them you'd like to help the Office Team get started.</p>

<p>The office support team's mission is to enable volunteers to open and maintain offices in all 50 states for Brand New Congress. There will eventually be hundreds of offices, with at least one in virtually every Congressional District. The team will help volunteers set up new Brand New Congress offices, and convert existing grassroots offices and old Bernie offices into Brand New Congress offices where volunteers want to do that. You are: An enthusiastic leader who believes that volunteers should be able to run their own offices. Maybe you've worked in a Bernie office yourself -- either that was run well, or not so well. This is your chance to create a culture of positive, organized volunteer leadership at the center of the Brand New Congress movement.</p>

<p>If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! <a href="http://BrandNewCongress.org/call ">Click here to join one.</a></p>

<p>We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.</p>

                    <h3>America needs an <span class="heavy">honest, accountable Congress</span> to enact <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">Bernie's program</a>. But trying to win each
                    Congressional seat one-by-one is impossible. So let's run one campaign to replace Congress all at once (except those already on board) that whips up the same enthusiasm, volunteerism and money as Bernie's presidential campaign.</h3>


                    <h3>We're building on the tools, tactics and networks that we developed together on Bernie's campaign. But to pull this off, the volunteer movement will have to wield more power
                    and resources than on any campaign before. This means volunteers on the ground will run their own offices and voter contact operations, and will have access to all necessary tools
                    and materials from the start. Get ready for <a href="#timeline"><span class="heavy">the most beautiful campaign</span></a> ever.</h3>

<ul><li>Create enough excitement nationally that new voters will register and vote in congressional primaries, all of which historically have very low turnout</li>
<li>Massively scale voter contact: our national volunteer force will overwhelm incumbents tiny paid local staff.</li>
<li>Gain huge economies of scale in advertising, direct mail, and staffing.</li>
<li>Use one constantly-improving campaign infrastructure as we move from election to election.</li>

           <ul><li>Stake out high profile battles over things that really matter to America: jobs, criminal justice reform, the environment and more. </li>
          <li>Use our presence in Congress and our national grassroots movement to shine a light on entrenched corruption every single day, as the remnants of the establishment fight to protect their special interest patrons.</li>
    <li>Never stop campaigning as a national movement for more seats until we get the super majority we need to make real change!</li></ul>
