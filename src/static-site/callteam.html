    <h2>What's the timeline? And how is this actually going to work?</h2>
    <p class="lead">Trying to replace virtually everyone in Congress in one fell swoop may sound like a daunting project, but we believe there's now a way to do this by running a single unified campaign that all of America can get excited about and participate in.</p>

          <li>Are good at what they do. </li>

        <h4>Campaign, campaign, campaign</h4>
           <p>We're going to challenge incumbents in their primaries&mdash;both Republicans and Democrats&mdash;with a unified campaign that America can believe in and will actually pay attention to. By running a unified campaign, we'll be able to: </p>
<ul><li>Create enough excitement nationally that new voters will register and vote in congressional primaries, all of which historically have very low turnout</li>
<li>Massively scale voter contact: our national volunteer force will overwhelm incumbents tiny paid local staff.</li>
<li>Gain huge economies of scale in advertising, direct mail, and staffing.</li>
<li>Use one constantly-improving campaign infrastructure as we move from election to election.</li>
<li>Let candidates focus on the issues instead of the logistics of running a campaign.</li></ul>

           <p>Hopefully, we'll win a super majority in the House and take a big bite out of the Senate. In that case, we'll pass our program in the House and rally the American people to convince their Senators to support it.</p>

           <p>But if we don't get a majority, this is what we'll do:</p>
           <ul><li>Stake out high profile battles over things that really matter to America: jobs, criminal justice reform, the environment and more. </li>
          <li>Use our presence in Congress and our national grassroots movement to shine a light on entrenched corruption every single day, as the remnants of the establishment fight to protect their special interest patrons.</li>
    <li>Never stop campaigning as a national movement for more seats until we get the super majority we need to make real change!</li></ul>
