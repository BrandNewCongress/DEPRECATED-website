    <p class="lead">Right now, this is just an idea that some of us Bernie volunteers and former staff have been talking about with each other. We're all busy working for Bernie until he's in the White House. But we're proposing the campaign for a Brand New Congress as something to work on next. Only something as big and worthwhile as this can keep the revolution going&mdash;and it's the only way to give Bernie the ability to make real change from the White House.

This is a politician who has dedicated more than 30 years of his life to public service. This entire time he has been fighting for the causes that have pushed him into public service. This is a person I can get behind and I will do everything I can to make sure people get a chance to hear his vision for America. Bernie created a movement to take people out of the sideline and into the political process.

We can work together to elect leaders outside of the the political apparatus who we know won't give in to the pressures of money and lobbying. We can elect our own people from this movement we have all built together. We can keep going because we have already built the foundation we need to organize a massive effort to elect a new congress. Alone, we can only do so much to fight for justice and inequality.

Yet, over and over again I see the will and interest of the people put on the sidelines of the will and interests of big money.  I see the people in this wealthy country suffering and dying of treatable medical conditions because big pharma and big insurance companies lobby against us. I see my children and our planet's future in peril because big fossil fuel money has slowed climate action to a crawl. I see people of color being being imprisoned unjustly because the private prison industry has written our laws to fill their cages and increase their profits.  This movement is about standing up to the corrupting influence of all that big money in order to create a political and economic system that reflects our values and works for all of us.

Less than 20% of the House and 6% of the Senate are people of color. And women – while being half of the population – are only represented by 19% of female congressional members. By finding and supporting candidates of color and women, we can move forward towards achieving racial and gender parity in both chambers of Congress and build a representative body that adequately reflects the diversity of we, the people.

The time is is now and the time is right. We have the momentum to bring in a new mindset to our political process. We must stand up together to say enough is enough and to take back our democracy to force our government to fight for ALL OF US not just a handful of billionaires. <b>Andrea Perez</b>"> <img src="/static-assets/img/endorsers/andrea_perez.jpg" alt="img01"/> </a> </li>

However, more often than not, opportunities are often afforded a privileged few and the rest of us get left behind. I refuse to accept a system that does not work for all of us. I refuse to accept leaders who forget their constituents in the name of special interests. I refuse to accept a government that favors oligarchy over democracy. It is time that our elected officials REPRESENT US. We deserve better and I know we can do better than our current system. I am certain we can achieve this better vision of democracy because, thanks to Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, I have had the pleasure of working with incredible leaders in my community from many walks of life. They are immensely talented, selfless, motivated and have unbelievable work ethic. I am beyond thrilled that we will, once again, band together for the Brand New Congress to fight for progress for all! We will be an unstoppable people-powered movement. Together, we will identify, organize and elect proven leaders who will champion the will of the people and enact true progress.  <b>Zenia Perez</b>"> <img src="/static-assets/img/endorsers/zenia_perez.jpg" alt="img01"/> </a> </li>

We deserve more than the tit-for-tat nonsense we've come to expect from our elected officials. If we want progress, we're going to need more than just a handful of representatives to make it happen. Change of this magnitude calls for an overhaul. <b>Stephanie Rountree</b>"> <img src="/static-assets/img/endorsers/stephanie_rountree.jpg" alt="img01"/> </a> </li>

He's mobilized voters on a grassroots level in a way that I've never seen before. Time and again, he's told us that he can't do this alone and that's where a Brand New Congress comes in. It will take the best of Bernie's presidential campaign to win Congressional races across the country. Only when we have a bold progressive vision for the country being pushed forward in both the White House AND Congress, can we have real change for the better. <b>Ramon Ryan</b>"> <img src="/static-assets/img/endorsers/ramon_ryan.jpg" alt="img01"/> </a> </li>

I am a proud unapologetic LIBERAL (child of the 70s) woman of color. No Blue Dogs, no compromise, no surrender! #BernieStrong! The Revolution has never been about one man. The President needs a progressive, RESPONSIVE Congress that works for the People. In the words of Paul Wellstone, if we don't fight hard enough for the things we stand for, at some point we have to recognize that we don't really stand for them.  It's time to put our feet to the fire and get a Brand New Congress! <b>Wendy Sejour</b>"> <img src="/static-assets/img/endorsers/wendy_sejour.jpg" alt="img01"/> </a> </li>

The voice of the people has been subverted for too long. We have been silenced for decades and without an organization like Brand New Congress, the power of the people will remain suffocated. I have been involved in campaigns before, but never have I witnessed the kind of verve and enthusiasm that I see within the Sanders campaign. We need to harness this energy. Bernie’s message has always been that of empowerment and even though Bernie is a once in a lifetime leader, he cannot do it alone. Thats where a Brand New Congress flexes its muscle; it gives a voice back to the millions of Americans who are currently disenfranchised from the legislative process. This political movement will give us the tools and people power required to elect leaders who are responsive to us, not wealthy donors. I want effective change and I know you do too. It will happen from the bottom up. Brand New Congress is already paving the way. The revolution is at your door. Be vigilant. Stay active.

The vast majority of the country wants universal health care, secure retirement, better pay, affordable college, and childcare. We all want less war, clean energy sustainability and trade deals that actually benefit America. We all want to see fair, inclusive elections, police accountability, and investments in our country. Are we Americans worth it? Should our tax dollars actually benefit us, the 99%?
We think so, and we need a congress that unequivocally agrees to these core principals. Join us! <b>Dr. Nkume Sobe Jr</b>"> <img src="/static-assets/img/endorsers/nkume_sobejr.jpg" alt="img01"/> </a> </li>

Economic inequality is systemic and has had a hand in perpetuating racism and sexism, and fostering distrust and xenophobia, instead of bringing people together for the greater good. It's time we stop rewarding greed and the insatiable lust for money, and allow love to motivate real change.

The little guy in America is just as important as the big guy. We also need a Congress that will work together, regardless of bipartisan lines, to move us towards progress. Our Congress is supposed to compromise, not shut down the government because they don't always see eye to eye on issues.

It will be the powerful culmination of the tens of millions of us that have decided to take a stand against the perverse influence of greed, greed that can be seen from Washington to Wall Street. We have many daunting tasks before us and the only way we can achieve them is by sticking together. The only force strong enough to make the changes that must be made is unity.

We do not have the luxury to wait for good things to gradually happen over time. What is needed now, more than ever, is sweeping, systemic, sea-change in American politics. What we need is a brand new Congress, filled with progressive leaders who can work together to tackle the greatest challenges facing us as a nation. As a faith leader, I believe what Jesus called us to do is love God by loving our neighbor, in all sectors of society, including the government. We need leadership in Washington who will put the people first over special interests. I believe it is a faithful act to overthrow this unjust system non-violently and democratically. That is my hope and what I am committed to working for.

Campaign Finance Laws, Length of Campaign, Voter Suppression, Washington Gridlock, everything contributes towards making our elected officials not a fair representation of the public. And as long as our politicians are being bought by special interests, we will never be able to argue policies for their merits. No real change is going to happen without all of us getting together and fighting for it. Brand New Congress is a vision to bring people together and make our government represent all of us.
