                    <h3>America needs an <span class="heavy">honest, accountable Congress</span> to enact <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">Bernie's program</a>. But trying to win each
                    Congressional seat one-by-one is impossible. So let's run one campaign to replace Congress all at once (except those already on board) that whips up the same enthusiasm, volunteerism and money as Bernie's presidential campaign.</h3>


                    <h3>We're building on the tools, tactics and networks that we developed together on Bernie's campaign. But to pull this off, the volunteer movement will have to wield more power
                    and resources than on any campaign before. This means volunteers on the ground will run their own offices and voter contact operations, and will have access to all necessary tools
                    and materials from the start. Get ready for <a href="#timeline"><span class="heavy">the most beautiful campaign</span></a> ever.</h3>

<ul><li>Create enough excitement nationally that new voters will register and vote in congressional primaries, all of which historically have very low turnout</li>
<li>Massively scale voter contact: our national volunteer force will overwhelm incumbents tiny paid local staff.</li>
<li>Gain huge economies of scale in advertising, direct mail, and staffing.</li>
<li>Use one constantly-improving campaign infrastructure as we move from election to election.</li>

           <ul><li>Stake out high profile battles over things that really matter to America: jobs, criminal justice reform, the environment and more. </li>
          <li>Use our presence in Congress and our national grassroots movement to shine a light on entrenched corruption every single day, as the remnants of the establishment fight to protect their special interest patrons.</li>
    <li>Never stop campaigning as a national movement for more seats until we get the super majority we need to make real change!</li></ul>
