## Join a volunteer team

Brand New Congress is a volunteer movement that is structured in teams. Over the past few weeks, we've had a lot of growth and are now going to work to improve our processes and the quality of our work for a few weeks while generally pausing growth. However, we are taking applications for new team members and will begin on boarding again in a few weeks. We will not be able to add everyone who applies to a team. We are looking for people who can work well with others with a high level of professionalism, follow through, and good judgement. In the future, when we start ramping up local organizing and voter contact, there will be opportunities for anyone who wants to get started.

Please apply to join a team by filling out a form on one of the teams pages below, or emailing in to [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org). Include some information about yourself, your history as a Bernie volunteer or worker in other movements (not required) or other career and life experience. Feel free to include a resume or LinkedIn profile and any links to examples of your work.
