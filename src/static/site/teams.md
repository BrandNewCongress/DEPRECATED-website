# Join a volunteer team

Brand New Congress is a volunteer movement that is structured in teams. Please apply to join a team by following the instructions on each team page. We are also constantly looking for people who have special skills (like design, past policy work experience, etc.).

If you feel you can contribute something different from what's needed in the teams below, feel free to e-mail in to [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org) and let us know a bit about yourself and your past work.

If you are interested in organizing locally, you can get to work right away by using our [local organizing toolkit](/work). You will be interfacing with the local organizing team to get work done.

Also, if you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)
