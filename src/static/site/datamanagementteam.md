## Welcome to the Data Management Team page!

The Data Management Team keeps our the movement growing sustainably by keeping our database complete and well organized. Organizers throughout the movement send all kinds of data to the team, who then makes sure that data gets into our database in the right way. The team also regularly integrates various external data sources into our central db (for example, conference call attendees). You are: Someone who wants a consistent, well-definied way to contribute to the movement, and who has great attention to detail and great judgement about when to charge ahead and when to stop and ask if the way you're doing something is correct.
