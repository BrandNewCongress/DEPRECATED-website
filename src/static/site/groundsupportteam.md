## Welcome to the Ground Support Team page!

Our mission at BNC is to support local organizing teams that form across the country as we continue our 100-city tour. Our support will come in various ways:

1. Call list of interested volunteers and local leaders from tour sign-ups to answer questions and walk through toolkit.
1. Train local leaders and volunteers on how to set-up various types of events.
1. Connection between the grassroots and national campaign to provide goals and allocate resources.

## How to join the Ground Support Team

We are looking for task-oriented, high-energy, low-ego volunteers who are ready to take on a lot of responsibility and accountability right away. As we are still growing, potential team members should be comfortable working in fast-paced environments and open to change.

### Skills

If you have one or more of the following skills, please join our team! Applicants should be capable of updating, editing, or even writing guides, process documents, and other pieces of work that may come to existence in the toolkit. We are going to be talking to a lot of volunteers who we need to plug in right away to keep growing -- having patience and understanding while on the phone or responding digitally is a must while communicating with other volunteers and local leaders. Anyone who has organized events of any kind that bring people together would also be a great fit. Ground support will be helping teams form, host a variety of event types, and make sure that in doing so, local organizing groups are actively meeting their goals.

### How to apply

After [attending a general orientation conference call](http://brandnewcongress.org/call), start by completing the [Ground Support Team application](http://goo.gl/forms/NTrn394Xn3AREZGr2).

Once complete, the team leader will reach out to successful candidates via email inviting them to schedule a one-on-one follow-up call. You can do so here: [calendly.com/rojasalexandra37 schedule time]. After discussing the nature of the Ground Support team's work, signing the BNC volunteer guide and data agreement, and making sure you're a good fit, you will be invited to Slack.
