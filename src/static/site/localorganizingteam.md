## Welcome to the Local Organizing Team page!

Our mission at BNC is to support the local organizing teams forming across the country. Our support will come in various forms:

1. Call list of interested local leaders from tour sign-ups to answer questions and walk through goals and first steps.
2. Train local leaders and volunteers on how to use our toolkit.
3. Connection between the grassroots and national campaign to provide goals and allocate resources.

### Skills

If you have one or more of the following skills, please join our team! Applicants should be capable of updating, editing, or even writing guides, process documents, and other pieces of work that may come to existence in the toolkit. We are going to be talking to a lot of volunteers who we need to plug in right away to keep growing -- having patience and understanding while on the phone or responding digitally is a must while communicating with other volunteers and local leaders. Anyone who has organized events of any kind that bring people together would also be a great fit. Ground support will be helping teams form, host a variety of event types, and make sure that in doing so, local organizing groups are actively meeting their goals.

### Commitment

This role requires at least 8 hours a week. As we will be calling through a list of folks, assignments may need to be completed between 9 am local time - 7 pm local time.
