## Welcome to the Local Organizing Team page!

Our mission at BNC is to support local organizing teams that form across the country as we continue our 100-city tour. Our support will come in various ways:

1. Call list of interested volunteers and local leaders from tour sign-ups to answer questions and walk through toolkit.
1. Train local leaders and volunteers on how to set-up various types of events.
1. Connection between the grassroots and national campaign to provide goals and allocate resources.

## How to join the Local Organizing Team

We are looking for task-oriented, high-energy, low-ego volunteers who are ready to take on a lot of responsibility and accountability right away. As we are still growing, potential team members should be comfortable working in fast-paced environments and open to change. To join, use the following steps:

1. [Attend a general orientation conference call.](/call)

1. Receive email/call to schedule a training call or google hangout.
1. Sign Volunteer Guide and Data Agreement.
1. Join Slack.
1. Run through mock call and basic to-do's to make sure you are ready to get started!

### Skills

If you have one or more of the following skills, please join our team! Applicants should be capable of updating, editing, or even writing guides, process documents, and other pieces of work that may come to existence in the toolkit. We are going to be talking to a lot of volunteers who we need to plug in right away to keep growing -- having patience and understanding while on the phone or responding digitally is a must while communicating with other volunteers and local leaders. Anyone who has organized events of any kind that bring people together would also be a great fit. Ground support will be helping teams form, host a variety of event types, and make sure that in doing so, local organizing groups are actively meeting their goals.

### Commitment

This role requires at least 8 hours a week. As we will be calling through a list of folks, assignments may need to be completed between 9 am local time - 7 pm local time.
