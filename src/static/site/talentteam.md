## Welcome to the Talent Scout Team page!

The Talent Scout Team spots future talent by listening in on volunteer orientation calls and other means.

As a member of the Talent Scout team, you will be working to make sure that no one slips through the cracks or is left behind in our volunteer-powered organization. For example, you will listen in on, or listen to recordings of volunteer orientation calls and enter notes into our volunteer database about what individuals want to do, and what experience and skills may be.

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Talent Scout Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

If you'd like to join the Talent Scout Team, follow the steps below:
1. Read all the information on the [front page](/home) of the site and read the [Frequently Asked Questions](/faq) page.
2. Join a BNC orientation conference call. [The schedule is here](/call).
3. If, after learning more about BNC and hearing about other teams, you'd still like to join this team, [please take notes on a sample call using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Gdj_JUCocfBD_rFX_xe53foDIt3Pj0fPyH5V885Fank/viewform). We'll get back to you as soon as we can!
