## Welcome to the Speaker Team page!

The Speaker Team spreads the BNC message through orientation calls and in-person events, and recruits local organizers as messengers for BNC. This team is responsible for scheduling speakers for BNC orientation calls and BNC tour events.

## How to join the Speaker Team

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not onboarding new members right at this moment for this team, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!
