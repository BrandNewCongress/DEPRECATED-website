## Welcome to the Platform Team page!

The Platform Team will play a critical role in our campaign by translating Bernie’s platform into concrete legislation that the Brand New Congress, when elected, will pass. Over time, this team will grow into many different teams, each of them covering a specific issue or piece of legislation.

This team hasn’t started yet, but we’re looking to bring together professors, policy experts, legislative wonks, authors, students and thinkers from all fields. So whether your field of expertise is economic inequality, social justice, politics, history, law, education, healthcare, criminal justice reform or climate change, we need your help. (Bonus points if you wrote a book or did a TED Talk on your topic!)

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Platform Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Platform Team get started.
