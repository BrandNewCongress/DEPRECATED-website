## Welcome to the Conference Call Team page!

This team moderates and hosts conference calls for various team leaders & other speakers. Currently, we use the Maestro conference call system, (though we may experiment with other tools - including video chat!) to facilitate smooth group conversations among new volunteers and existing teams. Part of our team's role will be to host conference calls, but we will also be responsible for some administrative and technical tasks, so we can still use people who don't want to lead the calls.

The conference call team is just now forming, and we need you!
### Ideal team members have great attention to detail, are fairly web savvy, and above all, reliable! If you say you'll be somewhere, you'll be there&mdash;10 minutes early!

## How to join the Conference Call Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!
