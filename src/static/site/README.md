# Brand New Congress Static Pages

All the files listed here are [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) documents that exist at http://brandnewcongress.org/<filename>. You can add new files here and they will automatically exist at a new URL on brandnewcongress.org, or you can edit existing files.

## Creating and modifying content

To edit an existing page:

1. Click into the page here and then click the pencil icon at the top right corner of the page.
2. After making your edits, scroll down, give your edit a name and a description of what you did.
3. Click "Propose this file change".
4. This will lead you to a screen showing the difference between what existed and what you propesed.  Click "Create pull request" to confirm the proposed change.
5. Click "Create pull request" once more with any additional information you'd like to provide.
6. Your "pull request" will show up on [the website pull requests page](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/website/pulls).

Pull requests are a way to manage suggested modifications to a Github repository.  Once a pull request is made, one of the website administrators can review it and merge it in, resulting in the site being updated with your change.

To create a new page, you'll need to follow the same steps as above except, instead of clicking into a document and clicking the pencil icon, you need to just click "Create new page" within the file listing.
