## Welcome to the Wiki Team page!

The Wiki Team watches over the Brand New Congress wiki, constantly cleaning it up and reorganizing it. **You are:** Someone with experience editing Wiki's or who is excited to learn about them. (If you're curious, check out: [meatballwiki.org](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/))

We're a volunteer organization that is stretched thin right now, so we apologize in advance if we are not able to get back to you. Please do be persistent and keep emailing in if you are someone who: Works well with others, has good web design/development skills and definitely has some regular time to commit to this project every week.

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Wiki Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Wiki Team get started.
