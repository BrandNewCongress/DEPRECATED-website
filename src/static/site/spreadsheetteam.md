## Welcome to the Spreadsheet Team page!

The Spreadsheet Team is like the Navy Seals of Google Sheet wrangling. You can set up a zip code VLOOKUP() that fills in city and state in your sleep! Pivot tables are no problem. We'll be sending the team big and small challenges on an ad hoc basis. Are you ready?! **You are:** A spreadsheet superhero and you don't mind doing the tedious stuff when automation can't take care of the problem.

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Spreadsheet Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Spreadsheet Team get started.
