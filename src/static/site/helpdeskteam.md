## Welcome to the Helpdesk Team page!

Helpdesk responds to emails sent to BNC and questions that come up in social media. Our goal is to have a team that is the virtual nerve center of the whole campaign. The helpdesk knows what's going on all throughout the campaign, and connects people with the right team or team leader when necessary. It also sometimes processes interesting and complex data coming into the campaign, which allows us to launch new processes without having to first set up a carved-in-stone set of forms or tools to deal with the incoming data.

We use pre-written responses to frequently asked questions to make the work easier. We personalize and customize each email, however, and it's our team's responsibility to make sure every email gets a reply as quickly as possible.

We really need you! [Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already](/call)! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Helpdesk Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!
