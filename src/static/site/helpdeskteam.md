## Welcome to the Helpdesk Team page!

You will be responding to emails received by the campaign. Our goal for the helpdesk is to have a team that is the virtual nerve center of the whole campaign. The helpdesk knows what's going on all throughout the campaign, and connects people with the right team or team leader when necessary. It also sometimes processes interesting and complex data coming into the campaign, which allows us to launch new processes without having to first set up a carved-in-stone set of forms or tools to deal with the incoming data.

We've got pre-written responses to frequently asked questions to make the work easier. However, it's your responsibility to personalize and customize each email. And it's our team's responsibility to make sure every email gets a reply within 24 hours! We are looking for task-oriented, high-energy, low-ego volunteers who are ready to take on a lot of responsibility and accountability right away.

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.
