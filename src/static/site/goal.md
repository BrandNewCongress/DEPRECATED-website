# The Goal

We want to end the poverty and suffering of tens of millions of Americans, reverse the effects of climate change so the world does not end by 2100, end our policies that keep destabilizing other countries, ruining the lives of millions abroad, and restore our democracy to go back to representing all of the people instead of just monied interests so we don't end up in the same situation again. We believe these are dire issues and decades of undirected, incremental changes won't be enough.

Our goal is to create a plan to fix the issues above and implement that plan by replacing Congress all at once with a Brand New Congress in 2018 that agrees to the plan. We want to create a Congress that represents and reflects the American people, is not beholden to a handful of wealthy individuals, and is full of honest people with a track record of service.

Replacing the majority of Congress all at once might seem crazy, but it is achievable by running all of these candidates as a single, unified campaign.

We are working on fleshing out the full plan we wish to enact, but we know it will include the following:

* Rebuild the economy. Our mission is not merely to support policies that "encourage" or "incentivize" job creation. We wish to have the government invest in a massive rebuilding project in partnership with businesses in America that will create entirely new industries including ones focused on moving us rapidly to 100% renewable energy, bring back missing industries, and fix our current crumbling infrastructure. This rebuilding program will make America a high-wage and full-employment country. It will also position us well for the dramatic economic transitions that are coming as entire types of work become automated in the decades ahead.

* Completely change our criminal justice system. The current system unfairly targets people of color, fails to address this nation's huge problem with rescidivism, and will be looked at by future generations as one of America's worst human rights violations of this era. We need to fundamentally change the way we think about criminal justice by switching to a rehabilitative system that spends  its money on integrating offenders back into society and focuses entirely on reducing our nation's prison population.

* Guarantee a higher standard of living for everyone. It is shameful that the richest country in the world sees the levels of poverty that it currently does. We believe rebuilding our economy will be instrumental in fixing this, but we also believe that all Americans should have a right to a basic standard of living that includes medical care, a good education including higher education, food, and housing. This is how we return the American dream which currently seems to have fled to Denmark.

* Become a 100% renewable energy society in as short a time as possible. There is no option but to focus entirely on switching to 100% renewable energies now. This means we cannot keep relying on easy energy solutions like fracking and will instead invest in the renewable energy industry and actually execute a plan to get to 100% renewables, creating millions of new jobs.

* Remove the ability for wealthy individuals and corporations to influence politics. This means getting rid of the revolving door between Wall Street and our government. It means repealing Citizens United. It means moving to a publicly financed, transparent system of campaign financing that amplifies small donations.

* Further the rights of people of color, women, and LGBTIQ people. These are groups that have suffered for years through discriminatory abuses. We do not want to lose the progress we've made, and we know there is more to be done.
