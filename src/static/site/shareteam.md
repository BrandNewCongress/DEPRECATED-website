## Welcome to the Share Team page!

The Share Team is a sub-team of the social media team that does one simple thing, does it well, and does it consistently: You share what our social media team posts on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere! You are: Someone who wants to help Brand New Congress in a big way, but only has a few miniutes to give a day. This is a really big and important contribution to make, as it reaches new people and gets them involved.

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Share Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Share Team get started.
