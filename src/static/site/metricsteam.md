## Welcome to the Metrics Team page!

Brand New Congress is going to be a complex national campaign with countless moving pieces and thousands of volunteer teams working tirelessly to elect our slate of candidates. Therefore, we need a Metrics Team to track, analyze and report on everything our campaign does. The Metrics Team will use digital tools and human reporting processes to provide daily updates on the campaign’s progress.

The Metrics Team will require lots of work on the part of all our volunteers, including many hours of writing and finding content online. However, as long as you have an affinity for social media/messaging and a fervor for the revolution, we’d be glad to have your help on our team. (Bonus points if you’re already an experienced writer!)

This team hasn’t started yet, but we’re looking for responsible, reliable, task-oriented volunteers who can work on a daily basis. As long as you possess both an affinity for analytics and a passion for the revolution, we’d love to get you involved!

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Metrics Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Metrics Team get started.
