## Welcome to the Legal Team page!

The Legal Team will play a critical role in every stage of our movement — whether it's writing legal documents, getting all our candidates on the ballot or just making sure that our campaign does everything by the books.

This team hasn’t started yet, but we’re looking to bring together lawyers, law students, paralegals and anyone else who possesses both a legal mind and a fervor for the revolution.

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Legal Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Legal Team get started.
