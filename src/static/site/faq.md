# FAQ
## General strategy and structure
### What is Brand New Congress?

It’s a plan to accomplish sweeping political and criminal justice reform while rebuilding the American economy and getting to 100% renewable energy in a very short time—in other words, Bernie’s plan! We’re recruiting working people with track records of integrity and service in their communities, workplaces and families to run for Congress behind Bernie’s plan—and we’re going to run them in one unified, national campaign to replace almost all of Congress in one fell swoop.
Isn’t it impossible to defeat 400 incumbents in Congress in one cycle?

We know this will be difficult, but it will be easier to replace nearly all of Congress than to replace a single incumbent, and here's why: Few voters pay attention to their local congressional elections, especially in midterms. One big campaign for a Brand New Congress will attract enough media attention, volunteers and grassroots donations to overwhelm those no-name, sold-out, unpopular incumbents. Skeptical? Try walking your block and asking people who their Congress person is. Ask them if they'd like a Brand New Congress made up of non-politicians. Send your results to [us@brandnewcongress.org](us@brandnewcongress.org).

## Who will the candidates be?

We’re looking for people from all walks of life and all fields of our economy and society, representing every community, who fit these THREE criteria:

1. They are working people with a track record of serving their communities in their jobs, neighborhoods, religious organizations, charities, etc...
2. We can tell from their life stories that they won't sell out in DC, because many of their life choices have put others in front of their self interest.
3. They agree with the BNC platform.

Another way to put it is that we're looking for candidates who:

* are good at what they do.
* are proven servant-leaders to their communities, families, friends.
* have consistently passed on opportunities to sell out, choosing instead to keep serving their people.
* have, in general, never held or sought public office.
* agree on the core of the Bernie economic, social justice, and climate change platform.

The main idea behind BNC is that we're NOT going to run politicians. BNC candidates are people who actually do the work that keeps our country going: nurses, teachers, engineers, workers, moms and dads, social workers, veterans, law enforcement, first responders, managers and we could go on and on with this list -- but you get the idea!

We’ve got very high standards for our candidates -- which makes finding them very difficult work! -- and which is why we really need YOUR help!

We’re looking for people who are good, honest, selfless leaders in their communities, fields, workplaces or religious organizations -- people who are really good at what they do and are trusted by the people they serve. There are thousands of people like that in every district.

But BNC candidates also need to be people who believe that America already has everything it needs to fix our economy, our healthcare system, our schools and our justice system -- and that we can do it by working hard as people together. Like the vast majority of Americans, we don’t believe in any right wing OR left wing ideological silver bullet that will magically fix our problems. So we’re ruling out anyone who for example believes that simply slashing government will solve everything -- and we’re ALSO ruling out anyone who believes that simply growing government will solve everything.

Finally, we're looking for people who have the skills that would make them good candidates up against experienced incumbents. So they’ve got to be able to talk, and to develop a grasp of all the major issues affecting their district.

We’re making a list of potential candidates for each district, and then we’re going to twist their arms and convince them to run!

### Why don’t you want candidates who’ve served in office before?

We’re not banning them, we’re just saying that “in general” we want people who’ve never held or sought office before. There are a lot of great people in office and seeking office. But we mainly want those people who would never think of running for office. We want people who live for others. Those people do not usually seek out the limelight of political office. We are going to need to drag them kicking and screaming into public office. The longer our list of awesome potential candidates gets, the more they will inspire each other to run. When they see that this is not a vanity project but a real chance to change everything, we'll get their hats in the ring. It'll take a lot of work, but that's how it should be.

### Don’t people need experience as legislators to work in Congress?

No. Members of Congress should have experience staying true in the face of adversity and bribery. Our candidates will have that. Moreover, if we get enough seats, then we'll be rendering obsolete the game that's currently played in Congress. But seriously, this is not a valid concern. No one objects when a governor or big city mayor runs for Congress even though those jobs have nothing in common with legislating in Congress. And lots of “successful” Congress people have jumped in with no experience in public office at all, from jobs in banking, real estate and law for example.

### What is the Brand New Congress platform?

Basically the core of Bernie’s platform on the economy, environment and criminal justice reform. But see below for more info on this.

### Who’s behind this?
We are mostly grassroots leaders from the Bernie campaign and a few ex-staffers, most of whom began as grassroots leaders for Bernie. We have been talking about this idea for a while, and decided the time was right to launch it.

### Is there a formal organization behind this?
An independent political action committee called Brand New Congress is accepting contributions to fund travel, operating, and staff costs for a handful of organizers. Brand New Congress is led by a group of nine staff and volunteers called the working group. The treasurer of the PAC is a volunteer and former Bernie staffer, Zack Exley. We are required to have a PAC to accept funds and spend money toward electing federal candidates. PACs have a maximum contribution limit of $5,000 and must report all donations and expenditures. Once we have our candidates, formal decision making and fund raising will flow through them, with the PAC probably being dissolved.  

Our candidates are going to run in a single, unified campaign. The logistics, staffing, bookkeeping, media buys and so on will be handled by an entity called Brand New Campaign. The law does not allow tax exempt non-profits like 501c3s, c4s or PACs to exist primarily to provide services to campaigns. Therefore, Brand New Campaign is an LLC partnership whose operating agreement states that it exists not to make a profit, but solely to support a new generation of leaders running for office.

Saikat Chakrabarti is the owner and steward of Brand New Campaign and works as a volunteer and is taking no compensation from Brand New Campaign (or Brand New Congress). We are already developing Brand New Campaign’s capacities. Brand New Congress contracts with Brand New Campaign to provide staff, research and recruitment of candidates, travel support and more. In the future, Brand New Campaign will grow its in-house capacities and subcontract with outside firms to handle everything from research and field organization to ad production and social media. Brand New Campaign spending reports can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10fb5bWERgwYvfz_VDEiicM6em9_l7SSq6k0oYS-0aAY/edit?usp=sharing).

### What is a PAC?

To comply with campaign finance law, we created the Brand New Congress political action committee. That is not a Super PAC, but a plain old “PAC” with full transparency and contribution limits. You can learn more about PACs at [http://fec.gov](http://fec.gov).


### Does Brand New Congress have staff? Are you hiring?

Nearly all of the work on this campaign is done by volunteers, just like it was on the Bernie campaign. It’s a revolution, not a paid-staff organization. When grassroots funds start rolling in, we'll be hiring the best organizers in the movement who need to be paid. In the Brand New Congress movement, most of the team leaders who hold responsibility and authority are volunteers—people with day jobs they don't want to give up, retired people, people with small businesses, etc... Some organizers are paid. Paid staffers are people with a unique contribution to make to the movement who want work a demanding full time job for the movement. Being a paid staffer is a huge responsibility because one is taking up one of a small number of paid positions available, therefore standards for paid staff are very high. Funds are very limited, therefore Brand New Congress is not able to hire everyone we would like to hire.

### What about good candidates already in Congress? Are you going to run against them?

We won’t run against candidates that fully support the Brand New Congress platform. Plenty of members of Congress already do—for example, the members who endorsed Bernie. And we expect that as the campaign becomes stronger, more and more members of Congress will endorse our platform. In those cases, our candidates may drop out. We’ll have to decided on a case by case basis.

### Who makes the decisions for Brand New Congress? For example, who chooses the candidates?

As soon as we get our first batch of candidates, then they will be the ones ultimately in charge, and a leadership structure will have to come together among them. Right now, we’re just a group of people who agree on the platform and the organizing approach laid out here. We are bootstrapping this with a small group of grassroots leaders and a few staff who worked together and share the same vision of a grassroots movement to elect a Congress full of down-to-earth, trustworthy working people.

### Are you forming a third party?

No, we’re not forming a third party. America seems to be sick and tired of parties. Maybe the solution isn’t to create a new one. Or maybe it is. Either way, we’re starting off by running candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries, and then running independents where we lose. There are some similarities and differences between this idea and starting a third party. The big difference is that we are not trying to create a big bureaucracy behind our candidates. It’s just them. This will allow maximum agility which will be needed to win!

### Will you be supporting candidates in the 2016 election cycle?

We’re happy to see so many “Berniecrats” running in 2016 and we want to be supportive, but we’re just getting started, so we don’t think we’ll have that much to offer 2016 candidates. We think the way to win is to start very early and plan a great campaign. That’s why we’re focusing on 2018.

## Money and donations
### How is Brand New Congress funded?

We simply ask supporters on our website to pitch in if they can. So far we’ve been amazed to raise more than $85,000 in small donations.

### What do you need the money for?

The money is being used primarily for travel costs for our launch tour of 100 cities. Eventually it will be used also to start paying full time organizers, though this will be a mostly volunteer-driven campaign just like Bernie was.

### Your donation page looks the same as Bernie's and other Democrats'. Do my donations go to the Democratic Party?

No, we just use the same payment processor as many other Democratic candidates. ActBlue is a private entity with no connection to any party. It’s a great service for accepting donations. That’s why we use them.

## Platform

### What is the BNC platform? What do you want to do once in office?

We believe there are obvious solutions to America's biggest problems that the vast majority of Americans would fight for if they were put on the table in a national election. Why don't we hear about those solutions now? Because the current bi-partisan establishment agrees 100% on bad trade deals, on massive bank bailouts, on supporting the take over of our economy by the financial industry. It also agrees on mass incarceration, and on inaction against an out-of-control "justice" system. It uses partisan bickering over taxes and spending to cover up its consensus on those things that really matter and to pretend that Americans are pitted against each other in partisan grid lock.

The obvious solution to America's declining real wage is to build up America's means of making a living, just like every other industrialized country in the world has been doing, and like America used to. We need to invest in America's missing industries—high-wage, high-tech industries that are the foundation of the middle class in every other industrialized country. Part of this will involve an obvious solution to another problem: building a 100% renewable energy economy in one fell swoop. The obvious solution to the takeover by big banks of our economy is to stop subsidizing them with huge amounts of taxpayer money, and convert any that go out of business into non-profits whose mission is to invest in rebuilding America—for example to provide capital to businesses that want to build our missing industries.

In the coming months, we’ll be working with policy wonks, advocates and leaders in many fields to craft the actual legislation that a Brand New Congress would pass on Day One to put the plan into action to accomplish the platform. That way, people will know exactly what they're going to get with a Brand New Congress.

## Post-partisan organizing
### Are you really talking about running Republicans in conservative congressional districts?

Yes, we will challenge at least some incumbents in their party primaries, running Republicans in districts where only Republicans can win, and Democrats where only Democrats win. Wherever we lose the primary, we will run an independent for a second chance at winning the seat. But we will work out this strategy on a case by case basis. In some districts we might skip the primary and only run an independent in the general election.

Brand New Congress is not bi-partisan or non-partisan, we're "post-partisan." The two major parties in America have disintegrated into weak, sprawling sets of local and state organizations that don't know what they stand for. They are still relevant in one important way: they represent vague cultural brands that are important to something like two thirds of American voters—with Democrats representing a "secular liberal" culture for some and Republicans representing a "conservative Christian" culture for others.

The irony is that the core of liberal and Christian values are the same—at least in their ideals: Both cultures believe that they value human life, equality, freedom, peace, justice and progress. Those are not liberal or conservative values, they are American values. The problem is that each of the two of these cultures believes the other stands for the opposite of those stated values. For example, conservative Christians believe that liberal support for abortion rights means they do not value human life. And liberals believe that conservative opposition to abortion rights means they stand against freedom, and against equality for women.

We believe that America is heading fast toward a consensus around so called "social" issues—-a consensus that accepts:

* that laws should not be passed telling women what they can do with their bodies while working to reduce abortions through sex education, access to contraception, etc...
* that all people should have the same rights, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
* that no one should have to produce a birth certificate to go to the bathroom.
* that we can affirm American's right to own guns while passing common sense gun laws and massively funding violence* prevention programs where needed.

BNC candidates in conservative areas will to explain and demystify recent social changes in a compassionate and patient way to those who may feel threatened by them. We need to affirm that their most important concerns -- the value of human life and safety of all of our families -- are important to us all.

### What about "social" issues like abortion and LGBTQIA rights that sharply divide the parties?

America is in the middle of some radical social transitions on several important issues. On the whole, members of Congress are trailing behind their constituents in this transition. Brand New Congress candidates will be far ahead of the Democratic and Republican incumbents they are challenging. They will work with their constituents starting from where they are at, and talk through the issues with respect and compassion for those effected by them, as well as for those who are confused or scared by them.

* All Brand New Congress candidates oppose any attempt to legislate what women can do with their bodies—though most of the Republican and many of the Democratic candidates also pledge to fight to reduce the number of abortions, for example by championing sex education and access to contraception.
* They support people's right to live like everyone else, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, including the right to get married, and to access public facilities.
* They support American's right to own guns, and also support common sense gun control laws and pledge to support violence prevention programs in afflicted communities.
* They will be absolutely opposed to any kind of targeting of any groups such as Muslims or immigrants, and will instead work to protect all marginalized groups.
* Their position on illegal immigration is that it has almost entirely been driven by American businesses who encourage it* by actively driving illegal immigration and by hiring undocumented workers at sub-minimum wages. They are not much* worried about immigration because we now have negative immigration from Mexico and once we start rebuilding the economy,* we're going to need so much labor that immigration will no longer be thought of as a problem.

### So is this a bi-partisan alliance around some kind of centrist platform?

No! Haven't you been reading? A bi-partisan alliance is what we have right now: one that works on behalf of special interests to extract trillions of dollars of wealth from the American people. We want to throw that alliance out of Congress and replace it with a slate of leaders committed to rebuilding America.

### So why will conservatives support this?

The BNC platform is not about passing some regulations or taxes (two things most conservatives abhor) but about taking action over a limited period of time to hit the reset button on America's economy. That is something that a whole lot of Republicans can get behind. Republicans are just as angry as anyone else about the long-term decline of the American economy and are dying to do something about it.

As we learned on Bernie's campaign, many conservatives are just as fed up with corruption as everyone else, and ready to do something about it. Our goal in deep red districts is to find candidates from among those conservatives who have had enough and are ready to fight back. Yes, it's true that many Republicans have been brainwashed by Right Wing economics to believe that the only solution is to shrink the government almost out of existence. But on the Democratic side, neo-liberal economics comes to essentially the same conclusions as Right Wing.

The fact is that both Republican and Democratic establishments are equally as opposed to taking big steps to fix our economy and right the wrongs of our out of control criminal justice system. And among rank and file Republican, Democratic and Independent voters, there is an invisible majority waiting to be united around radical yet practical solutions.

Most conservatives oppose big government spending because for decades government spending has not been used as an effective tool to spur the economy back in the right direction. They are correct when they suspect that such "stimulus" only kicks the can down the road and does not address the structural decline in the economy. In the context of a full-blown plan, and a time-bound plan, to rebuild the economy, we believe many conservatives will support government spending on a massive scale.

Brand New Congress is not bi-partisan or non-partisan, we're "post-partisan." The two major parties in America have disintegrated into weak, sprawling sets of local and state organizations that don't know what they stand for. They are still relevant in one main way: they represent vague cultural brands that are important to something like two thirds of American voters—with the Democrats representing "secular liberal" values for some and the Republicans giving others a way to vote for "conservative Christian" values for others.

The irony is that the core of liberal and Christian values are the same—at least in their ideals: Both cultures believe that they value human life, equality, freedom, peace, justice and progress. The problem is that each of the two of these cultures believes the other stands for the opposite of those stated values. For example, conservative Christians believe that liberal support for abortion rights means they do not value human life. And liberals believe that conservative opposition to abortion rights means they stand against freedom, and against equality for women.
