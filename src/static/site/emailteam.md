## Welcome to the Email Team page!

The Email Team is looking for a few gifted writers, proof readers and html coders who will be able to help BNC team leaders communicated authentically and passionately with everyone involved in BNC via email. This team will also be responsible for conducting A/B tests and reporting analytics on our emails.

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Email Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Email Team get started.
