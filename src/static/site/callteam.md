## Welcome to the Call Team page!

The Call Team is a national team which often serves as the first point of contact for potential BNC volunteers and other interested individuals. Our members are among the most up-to-date on the day-to-day operations and organization of BNC. We pride ourselves on our curiosity, initiative, reliability, and enthusiasm. We spend most of our time with BNC literally speaking on behalf of the organization and we take it seriously, but we also wish to ensure people have a pleasant and positive first interaction with BNC. Our mission at BNC is to individually contact local and national volunteers and organizers from across the country as we continue to spread the word about BNC.

## Volunteer with Call Team!

**We need YOU!** We are looking for task-oriented, high-energy, low-ego volunteers who are ready to take on a lot of responsibility and accountability right away. As we are still growing, potential team members should be comfortable working in fast-paced environments and open to change. One of the roles that is rapidly emerging within the Call team is the need for team members focuses specifically on the development of our back-end systems (database building, scheduling, data-entry, etc.)

### Skills
If you have one or more of the following skills, please join our team! We are going to be talking to a ton of potential volunteers and donors from across the country. We are often their first point of contact. With that in mind, having patience and understanding while on the phone is a must while communicating with other volunteers and local leaders. You’re going to face the most excitable advocates and disgruntled delegates from across our great nation. You need the ability to make everyone feel heard and like they belong, without sounding fake or passing judgement. The ability to make a pre-written script sound like original, improvised thoughts is a major bonus! Applicants should be capable of taking screenshots, learning new things quickly, and should be comfortable working with computers and learning potentially new programs like Slack, NationBuilder, and Google Docs. Don’t worry, if you’re not super savvy when it comes to computers and stuff, we’ll teach you what you need to know! Nothing more, nothing less.

### Commitment
This team requires a commitment of at least 5 hours a week with an ideal average of 8-10. Regardless of your personal schedule, we have tasks that need to be completed during all hours of the day! We need to make phone calls 7 days per week between the hours of 9am-9pm. Most volunteer work involving our back-end systems can only take place outside of calling hours so night owls and early birds are welcome!
