## Welcome to the Social Media Team page!

For most of the American people, Brand New Congress is an incredibly radical and relatively unknown idea — therefore, we need a special volunteer team to help us spread the word and get millions of Americans on board with our plan. The Social Media Team will play a critical role in that effort by helping us spreading the word about Brand New Congress to millions of people over Facebook, Twitter and Reddit.

The Social Media Team will require lots of work on the part of all our volunteers, including many hours of writing and finding content online. However, as long as you have an affinity for social media/messaging and a fervor for the revolution, we’d be glad to have your help on our team. (Bonus points if you’re already an experienced writer!)

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Social Media Team:

This team has already gotten started, but we’re still looking for volunteers who are excellent writers (for writing marketing copy), content scouts (for finding shareable content) and social media experts (for implementing all the social media strategies that will make our outreach 10X more impactful).

If you’re interested, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/191oEnVw27GWSs-DnGiDtZDnvhhRsgxpFSZ8gwjCtuXE/viewform) to tell us a little bit about yourself and let us know why you’re interested in joining the Social Media Team. We’ll be sure to get back to you as soon as possible.
