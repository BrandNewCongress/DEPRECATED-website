# What does Brand New Congress stand for?
## Good Jobs in Every Town Available to Everyone
We need to work with business build new high tech, high paying industries here in America on a massive scale. We need to catch up to other industrialized countries by rebuilding our infrastructure and energy economy.
## Liberty and Justice for All. 
We need to repair and reform all of our institutions from elections to social services to policing and the justice system. We the People are sick and tired of being targeted, abused, surveiled, micromanaged, nickled and dimed and belittled by our government.   

# How will BNC do all this?

We can only carry out our plan if the American people give our candidates a sweeping majority in Congress and a partner in the White House. It will take at least until 2020 to achieve that. Until then, we'll be running a constant campaign across the whole country to win that majority (and eventually the White House!). In 2018, we'll use however many seats the American people give us to fight as hard as we possibly can for them and show them what we're capable of. We'll shine a light on corruption, act as a watchdog for the people inside the Capital, stop every bad bill we can, and win every part of our plan we possibly can.  

Once we have a majority, Brand New Congress will govern like America has never seen in peacetime: by actually getting stuff done! There will be no debating or horse trading -- because the BNC candidates all enter Congress already having agreed on the plan. We'll have all the legistlation written BEOFRE the 2018 election! It's what the American people will have elected us to pass -- and we will pass it on Day One. 

It will take at least until the end of 2017 to work out all the details of the legislation the BNC will enact. But the basic values, principles and ideas of the plan are available below. Right now, [BNCâ€™s Working Group](https://wiki.brandnewcongress.org/index.php?title=Our_Team-Based_Organization) is responsible for leading this process. Once we have a critical mass of candidates, responsibility will shift to them.

## The BNC Plan in a Nutshell
* **Rebuild the economy**: We want to end the poverty and suffering of tens of millions of Americans. [Read the working draft of our economic plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCFs5hqitbXBBqXxU6NULDyvydXqm-ALOqW21dv9P9k/edit?usp=sharing).
* **Make medicare available to all**: [Read the working draft of our economic plan for more details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCFs5hqitbXBBqXxU6NULDyvydXqm-ALOqW21dv9P9k/edit#heading=h.tdbse0vun2un)
* **Rethink the fundamental assumptions of our criminal justice system and move towards decarceration.** The current system unfairly targets people of color, fails to address this nation's huge problem with recidivism, and will be looked at by future generations as one of America's worst human rights violations of this era. We need to fundamentally change the way we think about criminal justice by switching to a rehabilitative system that spends its money on integrating offenders back into society and focuses on decarceration. We will be working with community leaders and other organizations to create a complete criminal and racial justice platform in the coming months.
* **Say no to wars of choice**: We want to stop ruining the lives of millions abroad by destabilizing countries.
* **Get money out of politics once and for all**: This means getting rid of the revolving door between Wall Street and our government. It means repealing Citizens United. It means moving to a publicly financed, transparent system of campaign financing that amplifies small donations.
* **Further the rights of people of color, women, and LGBTIQ people**: These are groups that have suffered for years through discriminatory abuses. We do not want to lose the progress we've made, and we know there is more to be done.
* **Become a 100% renewable energy economy in 10 years**: Not just because we want to have an inhabitable planet in 100 years, but because the new economy is inevitable at this point.
