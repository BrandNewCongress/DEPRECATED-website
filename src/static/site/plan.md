# What does Brand New Congress stand for?
___
## Good, Hard, High-paying Work for All
We will invest in new high-tech, high-paying industries here in America on a massive scale. We will catch America up to other industrialized countries by rebuilding our infrastructure and energy system. We will take Wall Street out of the drivers seat of the economy and put the American people back in control. 
## Liberty and Justice for All
Everyone from small business owners and rural ranchers to Black, Latino and Native American youth having come to feel their government is against them -- even preying upon their communities and businesses. We will repair and reform all of our institutions from social services and regulatory agencies to elections, policing and our entire justice system. We the People are sick and tired of being targeted, abused, surveiled, micromanaged, nickled and dimed and belittled by our government.   

## How will BNC do that?

We can only carry out our plan if the American people give our candidates a sweeping majority in Congress and a partner in the White House. It will take at least until 2020 to achieve that. Until then, we'll be running a constant campaign across the whole country to win that majority. In 2018, we'll use however many seats the American people give us to fight as hard as we possibly can for them and show them what we're capable of. We'll shine a light on corruption, act as a watchdog for the people inside the Capital, stop every bad bill and win every part of our plan that we can.  

Once we have a majority, Brand New Congress will govern like America has never seen in peacetime before: by actually getting stuff done! There will be no debating or horse trading -- because the BNC candidates all enter Congress already having agreed on the plan. We'll have all the legistlation written and published for review by the people BEFORE the 2018 election! It's what the American people will have elected us to pass -- and we will pass it on Day One. 

It will take at least until the end of 2017 to work out all the details of the legislation. But the basic values, principles and ideas of the BNC plan are available below. Right now, [BNC’s Working Group](https://wiki.brandnewcongress.org/index.php?title=Our_Team-Based_Organization) is responsible for leading this process. Once we have a critical mass of candidates, responsibility will shift to them.

# The BNC Plan in a Nutshell
## Good, Hard, High-paying Work for All
The BNC's plan calls for a mobilization on the scale of World War II -- one in which every American is called upon to rebuild and repair our communities and our nation. This plan unleashes resources to neighborhoods, local and state governments, small and large businesses and innovators to:
1. Rebuild and repair local communities -- starting with those that have been left the farthest behind.
2. Repair our nation’s crumbling infrastructure -- starting in the most economically depressed regions of our country.
3. Give small businesses the competitive edge in rebuilding America.
4. Build the inevitable free and clean energy economy NOW.
5. Totally eliminate health care costs for American business.
6. Build new high-wage, high tech industries that America is missing.
Imagine every unemployed person in your community or city suddenly having work, struggling small businesses suddenly on a level playing field with big business, and big business suddenly having access to the same capital, infrastructure and other advantages currently available overseas. Imagine America in action again, here at home, making our living in the best way we know how.

## Liberty and Justice for All
* **We will get money out of politics once and for all**: This means getting rid of the revolving door between Wall Street and our government. It means repealing Citizens United. It means moving to a publicly financed, transparent system of campaign financing that amplifies small donations. And it means all BNC candidates pledging to never lobby Congress after they're out of office.
* **We will give every government body new marching orders**: "Your job is to serve the people -- no longer to target, abuse, surveil, micromanage, nickle and dime and belittle the people your were hired to serve." We will back that up by removing government bureacrats who can't understand or won't comply with their new orders. And we will back it up by cutting out blatant and obvious waste, while providing generous funding and training to the agencies and staff that do the real work and that have been starved of support for decades. 
* **We will support the demands for justice from all groups that have been targeted by government:** Today just about everyone in America feels targeted by government at some level. What's sad is that they also feel pitted against each other. It's time for the American people to make common cause and see that the cries for justice by all Americans are connected including Black people, small business owners, Native Amerians, low income people, rural people, immigrants, disabled people, Latinos, manufacturers who want to build in America, small town governments, and we could go on and on with this list! 
* **We support the demands of [the Movement for Black Lives](https://policy.m4bl.org/end-war-on-black-people/)**. Including an end to encarceration, community control over policing, and massive investment to rebuild Black communities and to provide education to Black people of all generations that have been visciously denied it by our government.
* **Overhaul the IRS and the tax code** to stop targeting small business owners and working people who are just trying to make ends meet while turning a blind eye to tax evasion by mutli-billionaires and giant corporations.
