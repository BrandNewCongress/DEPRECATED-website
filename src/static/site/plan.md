# What is the Brand New Congress going to do?
## Rebuild. Reform.

Once it has a majority, the Brand New Congress will take an approach to governing that hasn’t been tried in peacetime since the founding of the Republic — we are actually going to get stuff done! Instead of debating and horse trading, the BNC will enter office with a fully formed plan that America has elected them to carry out. Though the details are not all complete yet, the basic values, principles and ideas of the plan are available below. It will take at least until the end of 2017 to work out all the details of the legislation the BNC will enact. Right now, [BNC’s Working Group](https://wiki.brandnewcongress.org/index.php?title=Our_Team-Based_Organization) is responsible for leading this process. Once we have a critical mass of candidates, responsibility will shift to them.

Once elected, the Brand New Congress will pass the whole plan into law on day one. What will we do if we don’t get a majority? We’ll keep fighting for a majority, and also stand up for the American people as best we can with the seats they give us.

## The BNC Plan in a Nutshell
* **Rebuild the economy**: We want to end the poverty and suffering of tens of millions of Americans. [Read the working draft of our economic plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCFs5hqitbXBBqXxU6NULDyvydXqm-ALOqW21dv9P9k/edit?usp=sharing).
* **Make medicare available to all**: [Read the working draft of our economic plan for more details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCFs5hqitbXBBqXxU6NULDyvydXqm-ALOqW21dv9P9k/edit#heading=h.tdbse0vun2un)
* **Rethink the fundamental assumptions of our criminal justice system and move towards decarceration.** The current system unfairly targets people of color, fails to address this nation's huge problem with recidivism, and will be looked at by future generations as one of America's worst human rights violations of this era. We need to fundamentally change the way we think about criminal justice by switching to a rehabilitative system that spends its money on integrating offenders back into society and focuses on decarceration. We will be working with community leaders and other organizations to create a complete criminal and racial justice platform in the coming months.
* **Say no to wars of choice**: We want to stop ruining the lives of millions abroad by destabilizing countries.
* **Get money out of politics once and for all**: This means getting rid of the revolving door between Wall Street and our government. It means repealing Citizens United. It means moving to a publicly financed, transparent system of campaign financing that amplifies small donations.
* **Further the rights of people of color, women, and LGBTIQ people**: These are groups that have suffered for years through discriminatory abuses. We do not want to lose the progress we've made, and we know there is more to be done.
* **Become a 100% renewable energy economy in 10 years**: Not just because we want to have an inhabitable planet in 100 years, but because the new economy is inevitable at this point.
