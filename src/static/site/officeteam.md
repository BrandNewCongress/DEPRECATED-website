## Welcome to the Office Team page!

The office support team's mission is to enable volunteers to open and maintain offices in all 50 states for Brand New Congress. There will eventually be hundreds of offices, with at least one in virtually every Congressional District. The team will help volunteers set up new Brand New Congress offices, and convert existing grassroots offices and old Bernie offices into Brand New Congress offices where volunteers want to do that. You are: An enthusiastic leader who believes that volunteers should be able to run their own offices. Maybe you've worked in a Bernie office yourself &mdash; either that was run well, or not so well. This is your chance to create a culture of positive, organized volunteer leadership at the center of the Brand New Congress movement.

We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!
