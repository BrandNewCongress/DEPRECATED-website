## Welcome to the Online Advertizing Team page!

The Online Advertizing Team experiments with online ads on various platforms as a way of reaching new Brand New Congress supporters. **You are:** someone with experience buying and monitoring online ads and a fanatical drive to get the most out of every dollar spent. You have no desire to run ads just for the sake of it, and believe that the best approach is always to be authentic and direct about about an organization's mission.

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Online Advertizing Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Online Advertizing Team get started.
