## Welcome to the Voter Outreach Team page!

When we think of voter outreach, we often think of the one-size-fits-all approaches, like canvassing and phone banking. But are those the only ways? Letâ€™s think outside the box and discover new and creative ways of engaging voters and identifying those who are fed up with congress and who support the idea of electing a brand new one! Some ideas we may be able to use all over the country and some may be strategies that are unique to the demographics of your congressional district. This is blue sky experimental thinking time! All ideas are great ideas and should be captured!
