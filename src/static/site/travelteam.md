## Welcome to the Travel Team page!

Brand New Congress will be running candidates in all 50 states — and that means that our organizers will constantly be traveling across the country to hold events, launch offices, recruit candidates and more. The Travel Team will provide critical support by purchasing all flights, booking rental cars and arranging supporter housing for all our traveling organizers.

The Travel Team has one amazing leader right now, and we want to give her some backup. We’re looking for eager, hardworking, task-oriented volunteers who are both supremely organized and passionate about the revolution. Also, we need volunteers who will be able to provide help on short notice, as our traveling organizers will often need immediate help while they’re out on the road.

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Travel Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

This team hasn't gotten started yet. We're looking for leaders who would like to help get it started. If you're interested, your first step is to read the information on this page including the timeline below. Then **email the help desk at [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org)** and tell them you'd like to help the Travel Team get started.
