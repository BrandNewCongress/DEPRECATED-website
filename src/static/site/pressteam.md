## Welcome to the Press Team page!

Our team's mission is to share the Brand New Congress idea with the American People through the mass media. We do this by fielding incoming press requests and reaching out and pitching stories to reporters and producers. Our team also conducts media trainings for other BNC volunteers to equip them for interviews.

If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! [Click here to join one.](/call)

We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.

## How to join the Press Team:

BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!

If you'd like to join the Press Team, follow the steps below:
1. Read all the information on the [front page](/home) of the site and read the [Frequently Asked Questions](/faq) page.
2. Join a BNC orientation conference call. [The schedule is here](/call).
3. If, after learning more about BNC and hearing about other teams, you'd still like to join this team, then take your best shot at writing a sample press release to announce a 100-city speaking tour by BNC organizers. You don't need to be experienced at doing this, there is Google! You can find plenty of sample press releases on the web. Email your sample press release to [us@brandnewcongress.org](mailto:us@brandnewcongress.org). Our help desk team will put you in touch with the team leaders.
