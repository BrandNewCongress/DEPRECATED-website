## Welcome to the Research Team page!

The Research Team is going to be central to building Brand New Congress. It will grow into many subteams that are taking on all sorts of research tasks including opposition research, ballot access, platform development, and more. The current task for the team is to gather outstanding facts positive and negative about every current memeber of Congress who will be running for office in 2018. You are: Someone who enjoys looking stuff up online and getting to the bottom of complex questions. You know how to write concisely and clearly.
