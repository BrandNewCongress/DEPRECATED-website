<h2>Welcome to the Travel Team page!</h2>

<p>BNC Teams are joined by applying. We're looking for team players who work really well with others and have significant time each week to contribute. We are not on boarding new members right at this moment, but please apply if you want to get involved because we will begin growing our teams again soon!</p>

<p>Brand New Congress will be running candidates in all 50 states — and that means that our organizers will constantly be traveling across the country to hold events, launch offices, recruit candidates and more. The Travel Team will provide critical support by purchasing all flights, booking rental cars and arranging supporter housing for all our traveling organizers.</p>

<p>The Travel Team has one amazing leader right now, and we want to give her some backup. We’re looking for eager, hardworking, task-oriented volunteers who are both supremely organized and passionate about the revolution. Also, we need volunteers who will be able to provide help on short notice, as our traveling organizers will often need immediate help while they’re out on the road.  </p>

<p>So, if you’re excited to jump in and take on serious responsibility, and if you have some time to spare, please email us at us@brandnewcongress.org. Just tell us a little bit about yourself and let us know why you’re interested in joining the BNC Travel Team. We’ll be sure to email you back as soon as we launch our team.  </p>

<p>If you haven't joined a general orientation call yet, please do! <a href="http://BrandNewCongress.org/call ">Click here to join one.</a></p>

<p>We really need you! Please attend an orientation call if you haven't already! And let the moderator know you want to help start this team.</p>

                    <h3>America needs an <span class="heavy">honest, accountable Congress</span> to enact <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">Bernie's program</a>. But trying to win each
                    Congressional seat one-by-one is impossible. So let's run one campaign to replace Congress all at once (except those already on board) that whips up the same enthusiasm, volunteerism and money as Bernie's presidential campaign.</h3>


                    <h3>We're building on the tools, tactics and networks that we developed together on Bernie's campaign. But to pull this off, the volunteer movement will have to wield more power
                    and resources than on any campaign before. This means volunteers on the ground will run their own offices and voter contact operations, and will have access to all necessary tools
                    and materials from the start. Get ready for <a href="#timeline"><span class="heavy">the most beautiful campaign</span></a> ever.</h3>

    <h2>What's the timeline? And how is this actually going to work?</h2>
    <p class="lead">Trying to replace virtually everyone in Congress in one fell swoop may sound like a daunting project, but we believe there's now a way to do this by running a single unified campaign that all of America can get excited about and participate in.</p>

           <p>We're going to challenge incumbents in their primaries&mdash;both Republicans and Democrats&mdash;with a unified campaign that America can believe in and will actually pay attention to. By running a unified campaign, we'll be able to: </p>
<ul><li>Create enough excitement nationally that new voters will register and vote in congressional primaries, all of which historically have very low turnout</li>
<li>Massively scale voter contact: our national volunteer force will overwhelm incumbents tiny paid local staff.</li>
<li>Gain huge economies of scale in advertising, direct mail, and staffing.</li>
<li>Use one constantly-improving campaign infrastructure as we move from election to election.</li>
<li>Let candidates focus on the issues instead of the logistics of running a campaign.</li></ul>

           <p>Hopefully, we'll win a super majority in the House and take a big bite out of the Senate. In that case, we'll pass our program in the House and rally the American people to convince their Senators to support it.</p>

           <p>But if we don't get a majority, this is what we'll do:</p>
           <ul><li>Stake out high profile battles over things that really matter to America: jobs, criminal justice reform, the environment and more. </li>
          <li>Use our presence in Congress and our national grassroots movement to shine a light on entrenched corruption every single day, as the remnants of the establishment fight to protect their special interest patrons.</li>
    <li>Never stop campaigning as a national movement for more seats until we get the super majority we need to make real change!</li></ul>
