      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>What does the Helpdesk Team do?</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">You will be responding to emails received by the campaign. Our goal for the helpdesk is to have a team that is the virtual nerve center of the whole campaign. The helpdesk knows what's going on all throughout the campaign, and connects people with the right team or team leader when necessary. It also sometimes processes interesting and complex data coming into the campaign, which allows us to launch new processes without having to first set up a carved-in-stone set of forms or tools to deal with the incoming data.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">We've got pre-written responses to frequently asked questions to make the work easier. However, it's your responsibility to personalize and customize each email. And it's our team's responsibility to make sure every email gets a reply within 24 hours! We are looking for task-oriented, high-energy, low-ego volunteers who are ready to take on a lot of responsibility and accountability right away.</p>

        <h3>America needs an <span class="heavy">honest, accountable Congress</span> to enact <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">Bernie's program</a>. But trying to win each
          Congressional seat one-by-one is impossible. So let's run one campaign to replace Congress all at once (except those already on board) that whips up the same enthusiasm, volunteerism and money as Bernie's presidential campaign.</h3>


        <h3>We're building on the tools, tactics and networks that we developed together on Bernie's campaign. But to pull this off, the volunteer movement will have to wield more power
          and resources than on any campaign before. This means volunteers on the ground will run their own offices and voter contact operations, and will have access to all necessary tools
          and materials from the start. Get ready for <a href="#timeline"><span class="heavy">the most beautiful campaign</span></a> ever.</h3>

    <p class="lead">Trying to replace virtually everyone in Congress in one fell swoop may sound like a daunting project, but we believe there's now a way to do this by running a single unified campaign that all of America can get excited about and participate in.</p>

        <p>We're going to challenge incumbents in their primaries&mdash;both Republicans and Democrats&mdash;with a unified campaign that America can believe in and will actually pay attention to. By running a unified campaign, we'll be able to: </p>
        <ul><li>Create enough excitement nationally that new voters will register and vote in congressional primaries, all of which historically have very low turnout</li>
          <li>Massively scale voter contact: our national volunteer force will overwhelm incumbents tiny paid local staff.</li>
          <li>Gain huge economies of scale in advertising, direct mail, and staffing.</li>
          <li>Use one constantly-improving campaign infrastructure as we move from election to election.</li>
          <li>Let candidates focus on the issues instead of the logistics of running a campaign.</li></ul>

        <p>Hopefully, we'll win a super majority in the House and take a big bite out of the Senate. In that case, we'll pass our program in the House and rally the American people to convince their Senators to support it.</p>

        <p>But if we don't get a majority, this is what we'll do:</p>
        <ul><li>Stake out high profile battles over things that really matter to America: jobs, criminal justice reform, the environment and more. </li>
          <li>Use our presence in Congress and our national grassroots movement to shine a light on entrenched corruption every single day, as the remnants of the establishment fight to protect their special interest patrons.</li>
          <li>Never stop campaigning as a national movement for more seats until we get the super majority we need to make real change!</li></ul>
