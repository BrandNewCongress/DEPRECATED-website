    <h2>Who's proposing this?</h2>
    <p class="lead">Right now, this is just an idea that some of us Bernie volunteers and former staff have been talking about with each other. We're all busy working for Bernie until he's in the White House. But we're proposing the campaign for a Brand New Congress as something to work on next. Only something as big and worthwhile as this can keep the revolution going&mdash;and it's the only way to give Bernie the ability to make real change from the White House.

            <p>When I was introduced to Senator Bernie Sanders last August, it was a breath of fresh air. This is a politician who has dedicated more than 30 years of his life to public service. This entire time he has been fighting for the causes that have pushed him into public service. This is a person I can get behind and I will do everything I can to make sure people get a chance to hear his vision for America. Bernie created a movement to take people out of the sideline and into the political process. Win or lose, we must do all we can to make sure this movement continues for the rest of this election and future elections to come. <b>Suad Abeeb</b></p>

            <p>Right now we have hundreds and thousands of people mobilized ready to participate and work together to change the system. I think this is an exciting moment for the people of America. We now know it's possible to take on the establishment with just grassroots power. We can work together to elect leaders outside of the the political apparatus who we know won't give in to the pressures of money and lobbying. We can elect our own people from this movement we have all built together. We can keep going because we have already built the foundation we need to organize a massive effort to elect a new congress. Alone, we can only do so much to fight for justice and inequality. But, if we stand together and spark a fire, we will discover that we are more powerful than we ever imagined. <b>Moumita Ahmed</b></p>

            <p>This movement is about no longer checking out of a political system that doesn't represent us but changing it so that it does.  The majority of people in this country believe that we should take care of each other&mdash;that no one should go hungry, that no one should go without healthcare, that no one should go without shelter, that everyone should have access to a quality education, that no one should live in poverty, and that no one should be unjustly imprisoned. Yet, over and over again I see the will and interest of the people put on the sidelines of the will and interests of big money.  I see the people in this wealthy country suffering and dying of treatable medical conditions because big pharma and big insurance companies lobby against us. I see my children and our planet's future in peril because big fossil fuel money has slowed climate action to a crawl. I see people of color being being imprisoned unjustly because the private prison industry has written our laws to fill their cages and increase their profits.  This movement is about standing up to the corrupting influence of all that big money in order to create a political and economic system that reflects our values and works for all of us.  We must run for office and support and elect candidates that won't be bought! <b>Patricia Bazemore</b></p>

            <p>Since the 1960’s, Bernie Sanders has been unwavering in his fight for social and environmental justice. His honesty, integrity, decency, and consistency inspired millions of us to come together to elect him president. We're young and old, Muslim and Jewish, black, white, and brown and have worked tirelessly for the political revolution. We must continue to fight for the agenda we believe in - regardless of who’s in the White House. We have the momentum, we have 535 reasons, we have the tools we need, and we have each other.

Although the presidential office is greatly important, transforming US Congress and the state legislatures will bring policy changes necessary to secure our liberties from the hands of huge corporate interests&mdash;like the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity that currently wields the greatest power in my home state of Tennessee. That's why many of us are joining the political revolution to elect a new Congress and to run as Congressional candidates, motivated to create a body that truly represents All of US, not just a few.

            <p>When Bernie Sanders declared his candidacy for POTUS, I felt like I'd woken up from a long political slumber. I've voted, contributed to, and even volunteered for political campaigns throughout my adult life, but rarely have I felt like my left-leaning voice had a true audience. Espoused commitments to universal health care, fair wages and equal education opportunities are too often met with statements that we're asking for too much and reasons for why we have to wait. I've heard I'm too idealistic so many times that I'd started telling it to myself. Thanks to the Bernie Sanders campaign and the folks I've met through it, however, I now know that my idealism is common&mdash;that I'm only one among millions of Americans who are tired of waiting, who are eager to make a revolutionary commitment to economic and racial equality, fairness, and economic justice in this nation. Senator Sanders has been straight with us throughout his campaign&mdash;his campaign is a wake-up call to American progressives.

            <p>One of the reasons why I'm excited to become involved with Brand New Congress is that we know the best way to move progressive policy is through having actual progressive lawmakers; you can't have a voice without having a seat at the table. Currently, the Rising American Electorate comprising people of color and women don't have equal representation in the current makeup of Congress. Less than 20% of the House and 6% of the Senate are people of color. And women – while being half of the population – are only represented by 19% of female congressional members. By finding and supporting candidates of color and women, we can move forward towards achieving racial and gender parity in both chambers of Congress and build a representative body that adequately reflects the diversity of we, the people. I hope you'll consider joining us as we take this journey of the evolution of the Bernie revolution by addressing some of the institutional problems of our political system. <b>Stacey Hopkins</b></p>

            <p>It will take the power and will of the people united to overcome the systemic ills we face, ills that result in gross social and economic injustice.  This movement is critical because we cannot transform systemic ills, the problems and corruption of a rigged system, by operating within the rules of that rigged system; we need revolutionary change, not incremental, superficial actions that lull us into pacification while oppression and injustice continue.  We need a potent, mass movement.  I'M IN! <b>Robert Overton</b></p>

            <p>Over the last 40 years we've seen our Republic become less and less Democratic.  As a result, it seems entire generations have opted out of the political process. Many have come to see our government as 'other' or separate from themselves; As an entity, and not as an extension of their will. But the reality and the beauty of our system has always been that it is possible to create the future we want if 'we the people' stand up and are counted. We only need to find 535 rational adults out of 320 Million Americans. The right looks at the plutocracy and sees a corrupt government; the left looks at it and only sees the 'evil' corporations.  But the truth is it's a two way street, and the the root of the problem is Money in Politics. While we come from different backgrounds and may have different conceptions of Justice-- our common goal is more important. The only way forward, is together. <b>Chris O'Hara</b></p>

            <p>A Brand New Congress is the next logical step for the Bernie Sanders movement. The Bernie Sanders campaign has opened the eyes of the masses. Now is the time to take advantage of the momentum we have formed, and give birth to a real humanitarian political movement that is here to stay. A president alone can not do this. We need a Congress that holds people above any big money interest and that truly represents the will of the people they work for. It is my pleasure to endorse the Brand New Congress initiative and to finally see real change at hand in America. <b>Julian Ospina</b></p>

I refuse to accept a system that does not work for all of us. I refuse to accept leaders who forget their constituents in the name of special interests. I refuse to accept a government that favors oligarchy over democracy. It is time that our elected officials REPRESENT US. We deserve better and I know we can do better than our current system. I am certain we can achieve this better vision of democracy because, thanks to Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, I have had the pleasure of working with incredible leaders in my community from many walks of life. They are immensely talented, selfless, motivated and have unbelievable work ethic. I am beyond thrilled that we will, once again, band together for the Brand New Congress to fight for progress for all! We will be an unstoppable people-powered movement.

Time and again, he's told us that he can't do this alone and that's where a Brand New Congress comes in. It will take the best of Bernie's presidential campaign to win Congressional races across the country.

            <p><i>"When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful." - Malala Yousafzai.</i> We must not let that be the voice of money! The voice of the people has been subverted for too long. We have been silenced for decades and without an organization like Brand New Congress, the power of the people will remain suffocated. I have been involved in campaigns before, but never have I witnessed the kind of verve and enthusiasm that I see within the Sanders campaign. We need to harness this energy. Bernie’s message has always been that of empowerment and even though Bernie is a once in a lifetime leader, he cannot do it alone. Thats where a Brand New Congress flexes its muscle; it gives a voice back to the millions of Americans who are currently disenfranchised from the legislative process. This political movement will give us the tools and people power required to elect leaders who are responsive to us, not wealthy donors. I want effective change and I know you do too. It will happen from the bottom up. Brand New Congress is already paving the way. The revolution is at your door. Be vigilant. Stay active. Get involved. <b>Nina Sherwood</b></p>

What we need is a brand new Congress, filled with progressive leaders who can work together to tackle the greatest challenges facing us as a nation. As a faith leader, I believe what Jesus called us to do is love God by loving our neighbor, in all sectors of society, including the government.
